### Features

- Grid Scalping Strategy: The robot uses a grid strategy to open multiple buy and sell orders at different price levels.
- Market Analysis: The robot identifies market patterns to determine the optimal trading time.
- Risk Management: The robot calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on predefined criteria.
- Performance Monitoring: The robot tracks profitability, trade frequency, and risk exposure.
- Automated Trading: The robot executes trades automatically based on the identified market patterns and optimal trading time.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL4 language and consists of several functions and constants.

### Libraries and Constants

The necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code. The GRID_SIZE constant is set to 10, and the MULTIPLIER constant is set to 2.

### Trade Functions

The code defines several trade functions for opening and closing buy and sell orders. These functions are placeholders and need to be implemented with the actual code to interact with the trading platform.

### Market Analysis Functions

The code defines two market analysis functions: IdentifyPattern() and CalculateOptimalTime(). The IdentifyPattern() function is responsible for identifying market patterns, while the CalculateOptimalTime() function calculates the optimal trading time based on the identified patterns.

### Risk Management Functions

The code defines two risk management functions: CalculateStopLoss() and CalculateTakeProfit(). These functions are responsible for calculating the stop loss and take profit levels based on predefined criteria.

### Performance Monitoring Functions

The code defines three performance monitoring functions: TrackProfitability(), TrackTradeFrequency(), and TrackRiskExposure(). These functions track the profitability, trade frequency, and risk exposure of the trading strategy.

### Main Trading Logic

The main trading logic is implemented in the OnTick() function. It first calls the IdentifyPattern() function to check if a market pattern is identified. If a pattern is identified, it calculates the optimal trading time, stop loss, and take profit levels. Then, it opens buy and sell orders with a predefined volume and current ask price. Finally, it closes the opened orders and tracks the performance metrics.

### Initialization and Deinitialization Functions

The code defines two functions: OnInit() and OnDeinit(). The OnInit() function is called at the program initialization and is responsible for setting trade parameters such as volume, stop loss, and take profit. The OnDeinit() function is called at program deinitialization and is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the program.

### Program Start Function

The code defines the start() function, which serves as the entry point of the program. It calls the OnInit() function, then enters a loop that calls the OnTick() function until the program is stopped. Finally, it calls the OnDeinit() function and returns 0.

Note: This code is a sample and does not contain the actual implementation for trading. It only demonstrates the structure and logic of the MQLSquare Grid Scalper MT4 program. Please refer to the official developer of this product for the actual code implementation.
